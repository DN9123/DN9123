Hello, I am DN9123. I am a young, novice programmer semi-fluent in Python and JavaScript.
I'm working on looking into how Python can be used in cybersecurity.
I'm also currently learning more about Python and hope to further my knowledge.
Not very active on Github, as you can probably see by my commits.
